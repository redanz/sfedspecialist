              “My daughter started attending tutoring sessions with Jaleh in the second half of first grade, when we were alerted by her teacher and the school learning specialist that she was below grade level in her reading ability. Our daughter is very bright, but was struggling with the de-coding and memorization skills necessary to learn how to read. And while our daughter has an incredibly strong work ethic, we knew there was something wrong because the results she was getting were not commiserate with the amount of effort she was putting in.
              <br><br>
              I had a lot of concerns about putting our daughter in tutoring, as I was concerned she would be stigmatized as being "not smart" or "not good" at school. In fact, the opposite was the result. Because of her one-on-one sessions with Jaleh, her self-esteem and confidence improved dramatically. She became much more autonomous and able to complete her school work independently. In fact, she would often brag about how "easy" school was because the concepts were ones she has previously covered with Jaleh.
                
              I would highly recommend Jaleh as a tutor and educational therapist if your child is struggling in school or has a potential learning disability. It's a very complex landscape to navigate, but you can rest assured Jaleh will be an advocate for you and your child. Our daughter worked with Jaleh for about a year and a half, and still goes back from time to time for some intensive review. I feel so lucky that we found Jaleh, as she is a wonderful resource.”

              “My daughter was falling behind. While her friends were reading chapter books, she was struggling with simpler stories. She needed help decoding words, seeing spelling patterns and developing reading fluency. Jaleh helped my daughter develop her reading and writing skills. She met with her teacher to get a sense of what would be covered and reviewed those topics the week before with my daughter so she'd be able to keep up in class. This not only helped her performance but helped her feel smarter in class.
              <br><br>
              Most importantly, Jaleh nurtured her spirit, creativity, and confidence and made her feel ready for middle school. Happily, her confidence has blossomed and she's getting straight A's in middle school. She couldn't have done it without Jaleh's guidance.”

              “Our daughter had been going to Slingerland speech and language tutoring for several years on weekly basis. We were concerned with her progress and engaged with Dr. Roth in San Francisco to execute a formal testing. He diagnosed her with severe dyslexia.
              <br><br>
              After the diagnosis, we were encouraged to get her into a Charles Armstrong but unfortunately they did not have space available for the upcoming school year that was weeks away from beginning.
              <br><br>
              We were referred to several tutors and recommended to supplement her existing education with 4 days a week of tutoring and to reassess at the end of the school year.
              <br><br>
              After meeting Jaleh, it was clear she was a true professional. Jaleh's experience and passion for helping children to improve is impressive. She cares. She developed a relationship with our daughter and fostered a desire to read. She acted as an advocate for our daughter's needs with us and teachers.
              <br><br>
              She achieved quantifiable results - having improved our daughter's reading by an entire grade level.
              <br><br>
              We would confidently recommend Jaleh to anyone looking for an expert to help their child. She is very good at what she does.”

              “Our son was diagnosed with dyslexia in 2nd grade. At that time, he was frustrated and not reading, anything. After the diagnosis, we were led to a handful of potential tutors, based on their approach and specialties. After meeting Jaleh, I knew it would be a good fit. Jaleh's experience and talent is evident in every task she approaches. She has been encouraging, demanding, always available for school meetings, understanding and generous.

              Isaac is now a successful 5th grader - good study habits, organized work and an appetite to do his best. We could not have done this on our own, Jaleh has been a huge part of helping put the 'train on the track' again.”

              “My nine year old daughter has been attending Jaleh for tutoring. She is a third grade student at Convent of the Sacred Heart, 2222 Broadway Street, Pacific Heights. Early this year she began to feel that she was falling behind at school. Her teachers had noticed a slight shift in her writing skills, specifically in her ability to edit her work. My daughter’s greatest challenge we believe is confidence in her ability. Our good friend recommended Jaleh to us. They had had a wonderful experience with her and felt that our daughter would respond well to her.
              <br><br>
              Jaleh has an authentic love for children; Our daughter was very comfortable and drawn to her. She never complained about going to tutoring, in fact, she looked forward to and enjoyed it. Jaleh is highly qualified and worked on spelling, writing, editing and grammar. Within a few short weeks our daughter’s teachers had noticed a legitimate improvement in her writing. The most important component for us was her increase in self confidence.
              <br><br>
              Jaleh is a wonderful teacher and a beautiful person, and when I try to summarize our experience with her a quote from John Steinbeck comes to mind.
              <br><br>
              “I have come to believe that a great teacher is a great artist and that they are as few as there are any other great artists. Teaching might even be the greatest of the arts since the medium is the human mind and spirit.”
              <br><br>
              I would highly recommend Jaleh as a learning specialist.”

              “Our son is a third grade student at St. Cecilia Catholic School in San Francisco. In the Fall of 2008 we were informed that he was struggling with reading, writing and comprehension. Knowing that this was a base for all future learning, we were very concerned. We knew he was very bright, but we just couldn’t figure out where the disconnect was for him. We met with his teacher and learning specialist in hopes of finding the right answer for our son. They recommended several learning specialists, and we choose Jaleh. We found our answer.
              <br><br>
              Jaleh successfully worked with our son for 8 months. In those eight months he went from a first grade reading level to a third grade reading level. His writing and comprehension dramatically improved. As Jaleh tutored our son, she also worked in conjunction with his teacher and learning specialist, which gave him a wonderful support network. He has gained the confidence he needs to be successful in the years to come, and we gained a friend for life. Also, we have peace of mind, knowing that Jaleh is there to work with him if he should need it in the future.
              <br><br>
              Jaleh’s technique is clear, precise and well organized. She is loving, and truly treats the student as an individual. We are truly blessed to have her working with our son.

              “Our children are so very near and dear to us. When it became obvious that my son, now 11, was struggling in school with low self confidence and was close to giving up hope of catching up, I heard about Jaleh from his teacher. Soon I realized that other Learning Difference professionals were aware of Jaleh and held her in very high regard. My meeting with her gave me strength and hope. She has a warm heart, she is consistently positive, and draws on tremendous experience in the tutoring of children. Her style is always reassuring, while building knowledge and strength. We have now been with Jaleh for about two years. She is one of my son's biggest supporters and he relies on her for guidance and self confidence. Her contribution to his growth is invaluable. Because of the support she has given us we were able to stay in his independent school and have not had to make the difficult and disruptive transition to a school for kids with learning differences. My son and I are very glad to have Jaleh's experience and guidance. He has become more confident in his academics, more joyful and playful in his written expression, and more mature in his knowledge of the written language.

Jaleh’s multi-sensory approach was well-structured and individualized to meet the needs of my child and, while she demanded a lot of him, she was engaging, supportive, encouraging and very loving while working with him. Despite the hard work, he enjoyed his time with her and was tremendously encouraged by what he achieved with her.

Jaleh helped Maya overcome here early struggles with dyslexia using series of specific exercises targeting Maya’s learning needs and style. Through a demanding, yet consistently encouraging and supportive, environment, Maya gained confidence in herself and her abilities, and she was thrilled to be able to read Harry Potter books independently at the end of third grade.

              “We LOVE Jaleh! My daughter who has dyslexia and ADHD has been seeing Jaleh since my daughter was in the 1st grade. At the time I was pretty overwhelmed with my daughter's learning struggles at school, and Jaleh was so reassuring and supportive which I really appreciated. She allows you to sit in (somewhat out of sight) on the tutoring which was also very reassuring and helpful to see how she works with your child. She is very warm, loving, but she really 'works' my child. She is well trained (Slingerland), which is the same method used by my daughter's school (Charles Armstrong) which specializes in dyslexia. She has very specific methods and 'rules' to help guide comprehension, writing, math. When we started my daughter read with excruciating labor (very small words), and my 'helping' often resulted in crying, yelling, frustration. The school was essential but Jaleh was our 'homework glue' that helped us through that very difficult period. We take off for the summer, but my daughter always requests more sessions when school starts. My daughter is in the 6th grade and looks forward to workng wth her this year.”

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What ages do you work with?</h3>
        <p>
          I primarily work with students in grades 2–12. If you have questions about
          whether your child is a good fit, reach out and we can talk.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you offer online sessions?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Depending on the student’s needs, we can meet in person in San Francisco,
          online, or a blend of both.

        <h3>How is educational therapy different from tutoring?</h3>
        <p>
          Tutoring focuses on subject content. Educational therapy focuses on the underlying learning processes, executive functioning, and long-term strategies so your child becomes more independent and confident in school.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Do you provide assessments?</h3>
        <p>
          I provide informal academic assessments to understand your child’s learning profile. If a full psychoeducational evaluation is needed, I can refer you to trusted neuropsychologists in the area.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does it usually take to see progress?</h3>
        <p>
          Most families notice changes in confidence and organization within a few weeks. Academic changes take place gradually and consistently over time.
