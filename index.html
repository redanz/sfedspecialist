      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p class="section-lead">
        Every learner has a unique profile of strengths and challenges. I help students understand
        how they learn best and build the tools they need to thrive in school and beyond.

        <div>
          <h3>Whole-child, strength-based support</h3>
          <p>
            Sessions blend academic skill-building, executive function coaching, and emotional
            support. We focus on small, sustainable shifts that reduce frustration and build
            confidence over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I collaborate closely with parents, teachers, and other professionals to create a
            consistent, aligned plan that supports the student across home and school.

              “My daughter started attending tutoring sessions with Jaleh in the second half of first grade, when we were alerted by her teacher and the school learning specialist that she was below grade level in her reading ability. Our daughter is very bright, but was struggling with the de-coding and memorization skills necessary to learn how to read. And while our daughter has an incredibly strong work ethic, we knew there was something wrong because the results she was getting were not commiserate with the amount of effort she was putting in.
              <br><br>
              I had a lot of concerns about putting our daughter in tutoring, as I was concerned she would be stigmatized as being "not smart" or "not good" at school. In fact, the opposite was the result. Because of her one-on-one sessions with Jaleh, her self-esteem and confidence improved dramatically. She became much more autonomous and able to complete her school work independently. In fact, she would often brag about how "easy" school was because the concepts were ones she has previously covered with Jaleh.
                
              I would highly recommend Jaleh as a tutor and educational therapist if your child is struggling in school or has a potential learning disability. It's a very complex landscape to navigate, but you can rest assured Jaleh will be an advocate for you and your child. Our daughter worked with Jaleh for about a year and a half, and still goes back from time to time for some intensive review. I feel so lucky that we found Jaleh, as she is a wonderful resource.”

              “My daughter was falling behind. While her friends were reading chapter books, she was struggling with simpler stories. She needed help decoding words, seeing spelling patterns and developing reading fluency. Jaleh helped my daughter develop her reading and writing skills. She met with her teacher to get a sense of what would be covered and reviewed those topics the week before with my daughter so she'd be able to keep up in class. This not only helped her performance but helped her feel smarter in class.
              <br><br>
              Most importantly, Jaleh nurtured her spirit, creativity, and confidence and made her feel ready for middle school. Happily, her confidence has blossomed and she's getting straight A's in middle school. She couldn't have done it without Jaleh's guidance.”

              “Our daughter had been going to Slingerland speech and language tutoring for several years on weekly basis. We were concerned with her progress and engaged with Dr. Roth in San Francisco to execute a formal testing. He diagnosed her with severe dyslexia.
              <br><br>
              After the diagnosis, we were encouraged to get her into a Charles Armstrong but unfortunately they did not have space available for the upcoming school year that was weeks away from beginning.
              <br><br>
              We were referred to several tutors and recommended to supplement her existing education with 4 days a week of tutoring and to reassess at the end of the school year.
              <br><br>
              After meeting Jaleh, it was clear she was a true professional. Jaleh's experience and passion for helping children to improve is impressive. She cares. She developed a relationship with our daughter and fostered a desire to read. She acted as an advocate for our daughter's needs with us and teachers.
              <br><br>
              She achieved quantifiable results - having improved our daughter's reading by an entire grade level.
              <br><br>
              We would confidently recommend Jaleh to anyone looking for an expert to help their child. She is very good at what she does.”

              “Our son was diagnosed with dyslexia in 2nd grade. At that time, he was frustrated and not reading, anything. After the diagnosis, we were led to a handful of potential tutors, based on their approach and specialties. After meeting Jaleh, I knew it would be a good fit. Jaleh's experience and talent is evident in every task she approaches. She has been encouraging, demanding, always available for school meetings, understanding and generous.
              <br><br>
              Isaac is now a successful 5th grader - good study habits, organized work and an appetite to do his best. We could not have done this on our own, Jaleh has been a huge part of helping put the 'train on the track' again.”

              “My nine year old daughter has been attending Jaleh for tutoring. She is a third grade student at Convent of the Sacred Heart, 2222 Broadway Street, Pacific Heights. Early this year she began to feel that she was falling behind at school. Her teachers had noticed a slight shift in her writing skills, specifically in her ability to edit her work. My daughter’s greatest challenge we believe is confidence in her ability. Our good friend recommended Jaleh to us. They had had a wonderful experience with her and felt that our daughter would respond well to her.
              <br><br>
              Jaleh has an authentic love for children; Our daughter was very comfortable and drawn to her. She never complained about going to tutoring, in fact, she looked forward to and enjoyed it. Jaleh is highly qualified and worked on spelling, writing, editing and grammar. Within a few short weeks our daughter’s teachers had noticed a legitimate improvement in her writing. The most important component for us was her increase in self confidence.
              <br><br>
              Jaleh is a wonderful teacher and a beautiful person, and when I try to summarize our experience with her a quote from John Steinbeck comes to mind.
              <br><br>
              “I have come to believe that a great teacher is a great artist and that they are as few as there are any other great artists. Teaching might even be the greatest of the arts since the medium is the human mind and spirit.”
              <br><br>
              I would highly recommend Jaleh as a learning specialist.”

              “Our son is a third grade student at St. Cecilia Catholic School in San Francisco. In the Fall of 2008 we were informed that he was struggling with reading, writing and comprehension. Knowing that this was a base for all future learning, we were very concerned. We knew he was very bright, but we just couldn’t figure out where the disconnect was for him. We met with his teacher and learning specialist in hopes of finding the right answer for our son. They recommended several learning specialists, and we choose Jaleh. We found our answer.
              <br><br>
              Jaleh successfully worked with our son for 8 months. In those eight months he went from a first grade reading level to a third grade reading level. His writing and comprehension dramatically improved. As Jaleh tutored our son, she also worked in conjunction with his teacher and learning specialist, which gave him a wonderful support network. He has gained the confidence he needs to be successful in the years to come, and we gained a friend for life. Also, we have peace of mind, knowing that Jaleh is there to work with him if he should need it in the future.
              <br><br>
              Jaleh’s technique is clear, precise and well organized. She is loving, and truly treats the student as an individual. We are truly blessed to have her working with our son.
